Here I've created a multisignature wallet on ethereum using solidity

I've tested the happy cases so far in remix and now need to finish off the unit testing in hardhat

I didn't use any resources from existing multisig wallet contracts, so after I've completed this I'll read them after to see what I could do better here.
