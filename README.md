Here I've created a multisignature wallet on Ethereum using Solidity.

Although this is a trivial task, I want to complete it fully as if it 
were a bigger project, this will include unit testing, documentation,
security automated checks, a security audit, a functional front end, 
and deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. I'll most likely just host it on
a free hosting site such as vercel, and update this page with my own
progress.

- [x] Fully functional multisig wallet
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] 100% line and function coverage in the unit testing
- [ ] Deployed contract on testnet
- [ ] Verified contract on testet
- [ ] Front end built to interact with it
- [ ] Automated security checks (slither/echidna)
- [ ] Manual security audit
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deployed contract on main net
- [ ] Verified contract on main net


The only function not tested it the default solidity fallback function.
